# Flask MySQL Application
A web application developed using Flask and MySQL, complemented by Bootstrap for front-end styling, to implement a database solution for MUC, a fictitious company specializing in used cars.

## Overview

This project aims to create a web application using Flask and MySQL for managing a database system for MUC, a company specializing in used cars. The application allows users to interact with the database to perform various operations such as viewing table contents, adding new suppliers, calculating annual expenses for parts, and predicting budget projections.

## Database Schema

The database schema is designed according to the requirements provided by MUC. It includes tables for customers, transactions, cars, parts, suppliers, orders, and monthly expenses. The schema is normalized to the third normal form (3NF) and ensures data integrity through primary and foreign keys.
